Anyone who has ever traveled with little kids understands the challenges that come with it.  Recently my wife and I traveled to Colorado with our 3 year old and our 14 month old. Before we had kids the only challenging part of a trip was getting though airport security. The ride to the airport was a great time to talk and dream together and the flight itself was a relaxing opportunity to read a good book or listen to some music while someone served us water and peanuts 4 at a time.

This is not what a trip looks like with 2 little kids.  The only talking done on the way to the airport was trying to decide if our 3 year old really had to go to the bathroom again, or if she was just looking for an excuse to get out of the car.  The time in the airport and the plane ride itself is really something you have to experience to fully understand.  Who knew a 40 pound kid could take up so much seat room.  The only person I have ever seen take up more room was her 1 year old brother.  As far as they are concerned, the entire plane is theirs for the taking.  

The one benefit of having kids in the airport is the journey through security.  At most airports if you have kids and a stroller you get to go through a shorter, more friendly line of security, (apparently not Denver's, thanks grumpy TSA lady who couldn't care less that I had a stroller, 2 kids and pregnant wife).  This is pretty much where the benefits cease.  The rest of the travel time is filled with potty breaks, spilled food, strangers looking at you in disgust at the thought of having to sit beside your kids on the plane and tear, both from your kids and at times you.

Even though traveling with kids is an adventure, to say the least I still wouldn't miss it and here's 5 reasons why.

5)  PEOPLE SMILE:  People in an airport are such a hurry.  They rush to the airport, they rush through security, they rush to their gate and rush to get on the plane.  Once the plane lands they all stand up simultaneously as though the first person standing gets to exit the plane first.  But when you pass them by with a little kid who is not in a hurry.  In fact, it seems like the kid is trying to intentionally walk as slow as they can.  People smile.  When they see a 3 year old girl holding her 1 year old brother's hand walking through the terminal they cannot help but pause from their busy life for a moment and smile.

4)  I LAUGH A LOT:  Adults are boring!!  Kids are funny.  They say funny things and they do funny stuff.  They laugh at even my worst jokes.  Who wants to travel anywhere and not laugh?  Next time take a kid with you, I promise you will laugh and your trip will be better because of it.

3)  THERE ARE LESSONS TO BE LEARNED:  A trip through an airport presents so many opportunities to teach your kid.  Sure you can just yell at them to be quiet and do what you say over and over again.  Or you can use this giant classroom to teach them so many different things.  They can learn how to talk to people, how to treat people, how to look around and notice things, how to work hard (pulling their luggage...this will also make you laugh).  The truth is there are so many opportunities to teach your kid something while you travel.  After all, they are learning from you whether you mean for them to or not.

2)  THEY ARE NEVER TOO YOUNG TO SEE THE WORLD:  It doesn't snow in south Georgia, at least not real snow.  There are also no mountains in south Georgia.  However Colorado has both in abundance.  Maybe my kids will turn out to be warm weather beach people like their mom.  But I don't want it to be because they have never experienced the mountains and the snow.  I want them to see the world, and there is a lot to see so you have to start showing it to them early.

1)  ESCALATOR'S ARE AWESOME:  I've probably ridden on an escalator over a thousand times.  Riding on one with a 3 year old who thinks it is the most exciting thing she has ever done is not like those other thousand escalator trips I have taken.  Kids experience things with a new and exciting attitude that we lose as adults.  Whether it is watching my kids look in awe at an airplane or the ride for all the suit cases (baggage claim), I gain a fresh perspective to not take life for granted.

I can read a book on the air plane later, right now I'll enjoy seeing how many times we can hit the flight attendant button before we get yelled at.
